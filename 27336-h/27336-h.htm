<P CLASS="poem">
A dull little station, a man with the eye<BR>
Of a dreamer; a bevy of girls moving by;<BR>
A swift moving train and a hot Summer sun,<BR>
The curtain goes up, and our play is begun.<BR>
The drama of passion, of sorrow, of strife,<BR>
Which always is billed for the theatre Life.<BR>
It runs on forever, from year unto year,<BR>
With scarcely a change when new actors appear.<BR>
It is old as the world is&mdash;far older in truth,<BR>
For the world is a crude little planet of youth.<BR>
And back in the eras before it was formed,<BR>
The passions of hearts through the Universe stormed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Maurice Somerville passed the cluster of girls<BR>
Who twisted their ribbons and fluttered their curls<BR>
In vain to attract him; his mind it was plain<BR>
Was wholly intent on the incoming train.<BR>
That great one eyed monster puffed out its black breath,<BR>
Shrieked, snorted and hissed, like a thing bent on death,<BR>
Paused scarcely a moment, and then sped away,<BR>
And two actors more now enliven our play.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A graceful young woman with eyes like the morn,<BR>
With hair like the tassels which hang from the corn,<BR>
And a face that might serve as a model for Peace,<BR>
Moved lightly along, smiled and bowed to Maurice,<BR>
Then was lost in the circle of friends waiting near.<BR>
A discord of shrill nasal tones smote the ear,<BR>
As they greeted their comrade and bore her from sight.<BR>
(The ear oft is pained while the eye feels delight<BR>
In the presence of women throughout our fair land:<BR>
God gave them the graces which win and command,<BR>
But the devil, who always in mischief rejoices,<BR>
Slipped into their teachers and ruined their voices.)<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There had stepped from the train just behind Mabel Lee<BR>
A man whose deportment bespoke him to be<BR>
A child of good fortune.  His mien and his air<BR>
Were those of one all unaccustomed to care.<BR>
His brow was not vexed with the gold seeker's worry,<BR>
His manner was free from the national hurry.<BR>
Repose marked his movements.  Yet gaze in his eye,<BR>
And you saw that this calm outer man was a lie;<BR>
And you knew that deep down in the depths of his breast<BR>
There dwelt the unmerciful imp of unrest.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He held out his hand; it was clasped with a will<BR>
In both the firm palms of Maurice Somerville.<BR>
"Well, Reese, my old Comrade;" "Ha, Roger, my boy,"<BR>
They cried in a breath, and their eyes gemmed with joy<BR>
(Which but for their sex had been set in a tear),<BR>
As they walked arm in arm to the trap waiting near,<BR>
And drove down the shining shell roadway which wound<BR>
Through forest and meadow, in search of the Sound.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Roger:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I smell the salt water&mdash;that perfume which starts<BR>
The blood from hot brains back to world withered hearts;<BR>
You may talk of the fragrance of flower filled fields,<BR>
You may sing of the odors the Orient yields,<BR>
You may tell of the health laden scent of the pine,<BR>
But give me the subtle salt breath of the brine.<BR>
Already I feel lost emotions of youth<BR>
Steal back to my soul in their sweetness and truth;<BR>
Small wonder the years leave no marks on your face,<BR>
Time's scythe gathers rust in this idyllic place.<BR>
You must feel like a child on the Great Mother's breast,<BR>
With the Sound like a nurse watching over your rest?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Maurice:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is beauty and truth in your quaint simile,<BR>
I love the Sound more than the broad open sea.<BR>
The ocean seems always stern, masculine, bold,<BR>
The Sound is a woman, now warm, and now cold.<BR>
It rises in fury and threatens to smite,<BR>
Then falls at your feet with a coo of delight;<BR>
Capricious, seductive, first frowning, then smiling,<BR>
And always, whatever its mood is, beguiling.<BR>
Look, now you can see it, bright beautiful blue,<BR>
And far in the distance there loom into view<BR>
The banks of Long Island, full thirty miles off;<BR>
A sign of wet weather to-morrow.  Don't scoff!<BR>
We people who chum with the waves and the wind<BR>
Know more than all wise signal bureaus combined.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But come, let us talk of yourself&mdash;for of me<BR>
There is little to tell which your eyes may not see.<BR>
Since we finished at College (eight years, is it not?)<BR>
I simply have dreamed away life in this spot.<BR>
With my dogs and my horses, a book and a pen,<BR>
And a week spent in town as a change now and then.<BR>
Fatigue for the body, disease for the mind,<BR>
Are all that the city can give me, I find.<BR>
Yet once in a while there is wisdom I hold<BR>
In leaving the things that are dearer than gold,&mdash;<BR>
Loved people and places&mdash;if only to learn<BR>
The exquisite rapture it is to return.<BR>
But you, I remember, craved motion and change;<BR>
You hated the usual, worshiped the strange.<BR>
Adventure and travel I know were your theme:<BR>
Well, how did the real compare with the dream?<BR>
You have compassed the earth since we parted at Yale,<BR>
Has life grown the richer, or only grown stale?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Roger:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Stale, stale, my dear boy! that's the story in short,<BR>
I am weary of travel, adventure and sport;<BR>
At home and abroad, in all climates and lands,<BR>
I have had what life gives when a full purse commands,<BR>
I have chased after Pleasure, that phantom faced elf,<BR>
And lost the best part of my youth and myself.<BR>
And now, barely thirty, I'm heart sick and blue;<BR>
Life seems like a farce scarcely worth sitting through.<BR>
I dread its long stretch of dissatisfied years;<BR>
Ah! wealth is not always the boon it appears.<BR>
And poverty lights not such ruinous fires<BR>
As gratified appetites, tastes and desires.<BR>
Fate curses, when letting us do as we please&mdash;<BR>
It stunts a man's soul to be cradled in ease.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Maurice:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
You are right in a measure; the devil I hold<BR>
Is oftener found in full coffers of gold<BR>
Than in bare, empty larders.  The soul, it is plain,<BR>
Needs the conflicts of earth, needs the stress and the strain<BR>
Of misfortune, to bring out its strength in this life&mdash;<BR>
The Soul's calisthenics are sorrow and strife.<BR>
But, Roger, what folly to stand in youth's prime<BR>
And talk like a man who could father old Time.<BR>
You have life all before you; the past,&mdash;let it sleep;<BR>
Its lessons alone are the things you should keep.<BR>
There is virtue sometimes in our follies and sinnings;<BR>
Right lives very often have faulty beginnings.<BR>
Results, and not causes, are what we should measure.<BR>
You have learned precious truths in your search after pleasure.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
You have learned that a glow worm is never a star,<BR>
You have learned that Peace builds not her temples afar.<BR>
And now, dispossessed of the spirit to roam,<BR>
You are finely equipped to establish a home.<BR>
That's the one thing you need to lend savor to life,<BR>
A home, and the love of a sweet hearted wife,<BR>
And children to gladden the path to old age.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Roger:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Alas! from life's book I have torn out that page;<BR>
I have loved many times and in many a fashion,<BR>
Which means I know nothing at all of the passion.<BR>
I have scattered my heart, here and there, bit by bit,<BR>
'Til now there is nothing worth while left of it;<BR>
And, worse than all else, I have ceased to believe<BR>
In the virtue and truth of the daughters of Eve.<BR>
There's tragedy for you&mdash;when man's early trust<BR>
In woman, experience hurls to the dust!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Maurice:</I><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then you doubt your own mother?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Roger:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 5em">She passed heavenward</SPAN><BR>
Before I remember; a saint, I have heard,<BR>
While she lived; there are scores of good women to-day,<BR>
<I>Temptation has chanced not to wander their way.</I><BR>
The devil has more than his lordship can do,<BR>
He can't make the rounds, so some women keep true.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Maurice:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
You think then each woman, if tempted, must fall?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Roger:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Yes, if tempted her way&mdash;not one way suits them all&mdash;<BR>
They have tastes in their sins as they have in their clothes,<BR>
The tempter, of course, has to first study those.<BR>
One needs to be flattered, another is bought;<BR>
One yields to caresses, by frowns one is caught.<BR>
One wants a bold master, another a slave,<BR>
With one you must jest, with another be grave.<BR>
But swear you're a sinner whom she has reformed<BR>
And the average feminine fortress is stormed.<BR>
In rescuing men from abysses of sin<BR>
She loses her head&mdash;and herself tumbles in.<BR>
The mind of a woman was shaped for a saint,<BR>
But deep in her heart lies the devil's own taint.<BR>
With plans for salvation her busy brain teems,<BR>
While her heart longs in secret to know how sin seems.<BR>
And if with this question unanswered she dies,<BR>
Temptation came not in the right sort of guise.<BR>
There's my estimate, Reese, of the beautiful sex;<BR>
I see by your face that my words wound and vex,<BR>
But remember, my boy, I'm a man of the world.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Maurice:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Thank God, in the vortex I have not been hurled.<BR>
If experience breeds such a mental disease,<BR>
I am glad I have lived with the birds and the bees,<BR>
And the winds and the waves, and let people alone<BR>
So far in my life but good women I've known.<BR>
My mother, my sister, a few valued friends&mdash;<BR>
A teacher, a schoolmate, and there the list ends.<BR>
But to know one true woman in sunshine and gloom,<BR>
From the zenith of life to the door of the tomb,<BR>
To know her, as I knew that mother of mine,<BR>
Is to know the whole sex and to kneel at the shrine.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Roger:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then you think saint and woman synonymous terms?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<I>Maurice:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, no! we are all, men and women, poor worms<BR>
Crawling up from the dampness and darkness of clay<BR>
To bask in the sunlight and warmth of the day.<BR>
Some climb to a leaf and reflect its bright sheen,<BR>
Some toil through the grass, and are crushed there unseen.<BR>
Some sting if you touch them, and some evolve wings;<BR>
Yet God dwells in each of the poor, groping things.<BR>
They came from the Source&mdash;to the Source they go back;<BR>
The sinners are those who have missed the true track.<BR>
We can not judge women or men as a class,<BR>
Each soul has its own distinct place in the mass.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is no sex in sin; it were folly to swear<BR>
All women are angels, but worse to declare<BR>
All are devils as you do.  You're morbid, my boy,<BR>
In what you thought gold you have found much alloy<BR>
And now you are doubting there is the true ore.<BR>
But wait till you study my sweet simple store<BR>
Of pure sterling treasures; just wait till you've been<BR>
A few restful weeks, or a season, within<BR>
The charmed circle of home life; then, Roger, you'll find<BR>

I question your gifts as a prophet, and yet,<BR>
I confess in my travels I never have met<BR>
A woman whose face so impressed me at sight,<BR>
As one seen to-day; a mere girl, sweet and bright,<BR>
Who entered the train quite alone and sat down<BR>
Surrounded by parcels she'd purchased in town.<BR>
A trim country lass, but endowed with the beauty<BR>
Which makes a man think of his conscience and duty.<BR>
Some women, you know, move us that way&mdash;God bless them,<BR>
While others rouse only a thirst to possess them<BR>
The face of the girl made me wish to be good,<BR>
I went out and smoked to escape from the mood.<BR>
When conscience through half a man's life has been sleeping<BR>
What folly to wake it to worry and weeping!<BR>

The pessimist role is a modern day fad,<BR>
But, Roger, you make a poor cynic, my lad.<BR>
Your heart at the core is as sound as a nut,<BR>
Though the wheels of your mind have dropped into the rut<BR>
Of wrong thinking.  You need a strong hand on the lever<BR>
Of good common sense, and an earnest endeavor<BR>
To pull yourself out of the slough of despond<BR>
Back into the highway of peace just beyond.<BR>
And now, here we are at Peace Castle in truth,<BR>
And there stands its Chatelaine, sweet Sister Ruth,<BR>
To welcome you, Roger; you'll find a new type<BR>
In this old-fashioned girl, who in years scarcely ripe,<BR>
And as childish in heart as she is in her looks,<BR>
And without worldly learning or knowledge of books,<BR>
Yet in housewifely wisdom is wise as a sage.<BR>
She is quite out of step with the girls of her age,<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The gray eyes of the girl of nineteen<BR>
Looked into the face oft in fancy she'd seen<BR>
When her brother had talked of his comrade at Yale.<BR>
His stature was lower, his cheek was more pale<BR>
Than her thought had portrayed him; a look in his eye<BR>
Made her sorry, she knew not for what nor knew why,<BR>
But she longed to befriend him, as one needing aid<BR>
While he, gazing down on the face of the maid,<BR>
Spoke some light words of greeting, the while his mind ran<BR>
On her "points" good and bad; for the average man<BR>
When he looks at a woman proceeds first to scan her<BR>
As if she were horse flesh, and in the same manner<BR>
Notes all that is pleasing, or otherwise.  So<BR>
Roger gazed at Ruth Somerville.<BR>

Domestic&mdash;that word is the cue to her part<BR>
She would warm a man's slippers, but never his veins;<BR>
She would feed well his stomach, but never his brains.<BR>
And after she looks on her first baby's face,<BR>
Her husband will hold but a second-class place<BR>
In her thoughts or emotions, unless he falls ill,<BR>
When a dozen trained nurses her place can not fill.<BR>
She is sweet of her kind; and her kind since the birth<BR>
Of this sin ridden, Circe-cursed planet, the Earth,<BR>
Has kept it, I own, with its medleys of evil<BR>
From going straight into the hands of the devil.<BR>
It is not through its heroes the world lives and thrives,<BR>
But through its sweet commonplace mothers and wives.<BR>
We love them, and leave them; deceive, and respect them,<BR>
We laud loud their virtues and straightway neglect them.<BR>
They are daisy and buttercup women of earth<BR>
Who grace common ways with their sweetness and worth.<BR>
We praise, but we pass them, to reach for some flower<BR>
That stings when we pluck it, or wilts in an hour.<BR>

"You are thornless, fair Ruth! you are useful and sweet!<BR>
But lovers shall pass you to sigh at the feet<BR>
Of the selfish and idle, for such is man's way;<BR>
Your lot is to work, and to weep, and to pray.<BR>
To give much and get little; to toil and to wait<BR>
For the meager rewards of indifferent fate.<BR>
Yet so wholesome your heart, you will never complain;<BR>
You will feast on life's sorrow and drink of its pain,<BR>
And thank God for the banquet; 'tis women like you<BR>

In sweet pity's guise, with his arrows well hidden.<BR>

He hurls the whole quiver full into her breast,<BR>
While he pulls off his mask and laughs up in her eyes<BR>

So intent is this archer on bagging his game<BR>
He scruples at nothing which gives him good aim.<BR>

Ruth's heart was a virgin's, in love menaced danger<BR>

Quickly banished the dreamer, and brought in its stead<BR>
The practical housekeeper.  Sentiment fled;<BR>

The short-sighted minister preached at Bay Bend<BR>
His long-winded sermon quite through to the end,<BR>

That the stranger was bored.<BR>

In its tremulous depths, as they rose to depart.<BR>
Then suddenly Roger, alert, seemed to start<BR>
And his dull, listless glance changed to one of surprise<BR>
And of pleasure.  Ruth saw that the goal of his eyes<BR>
Was her friend Mabel Lee in the vestibule; fair<BR>
As a saint that is pictured with sun tangled hair<BR>
And orbs like the skies in October.  She smiled,<BR>
And the saint disappeared in the innocent child<BR>
With an unconscious dower of beauty and youth<BR>
She paused in the vestibule waiting for Ruth<BR>
And seemed not to notice the warm eager gaze<BR>
Of two men fixed upon her in different ways.<BR>
One, the look which souls lift to a being above,<BR>
The other a look of unreasoning love<BR>
Born of fancy and destined to grow in an hour<BR>
To a full fledged emotion of mastering power.<BR>

Told another.  Large, liquid, and peaceful as lakes<BR>
Where the azure dawn rests, ere the loud world awakes,<BR>
Were the beautiful eyes of the maiden.  "A saint,<BR>
Without mortal blemish or weak human taint,"<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The October day had been luscious and fair<BR>
Like a woman of thirty.  A chill in the air<BR>
As the sun faced the west spoke of frost lurking near.<BR>
All day the Sound lay without motion, and clear<BR>
As a mirror, and blue as a blond baby's eyes.<BR>
A change in the tide brought a change to the skies.<BR>
The bay stirred and murmured and parted its lips<BR>
And breathed a long sigh for the lost lovely ships,<BR>
That had gone with the Summer.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">Its calm placid breast</SPAN><BR>
Was stirred into passionate pain and unrest.<BR>
Not a sail, not a sail anywhere to be seen!<BR>
The soft azure eyes of the sea turned to green.<BR>
A sudden wind rose; like a runaway horse<BR>
Unchecked and unguided it sped on its course.<BR>
The waves bared their teeth, and spat spray in the face<BR>
Of the furious gale as they fled in the chase.<BR>
The sun hurried into a cloud; and the trees<BR>
Bowed low and yet lower, as if to appease<BR>
The wrath of the storm king that threatened them.  Close<BR>
To the waves at their wildest stood Roger Montrose.<BR>
The day had oppressed him; and now the unrest<BR>
Of the wind beaten sea brought relief to his breast,<BR>
Or at least brought the sense of companionship.  Lashed<BR>
By his higher emotions, the man's passions dashed<BR>
On the shore of his mind in a frenzy of pain,<BR>
Like the waves on the rocks, and a frenzy as vain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Since the day he first looked on her face, Mabel Lee<BR>
Had seemed to his self sated nature to be,<BR>
On life's troubled ocean, a beacon of light,<BR>
To guide him safe out from the rocks and the night.<BR>
Her calm soothed his passion; her peace gave him poise;<BR>
She seemed like a silence in life's vulgar noise.<BR>
He bathed in the light which her purity cast,<BR>
And felt half absolved from the sins of the past.<BR>
He longed in her mantle of goodness to hide<BR>
And forget the whole world.  By the incoming tide<BR>
He talked with his heart as one talks with a friend<BR>
Who is dying.  "The summer has come to an end<BR>
And I wake from my dreaming," he mused.  "Wake to know<BR>
That my place is not here&mdash;I must go&mdash;I must go.<BR>
Who dares laugh at Love shall hear Love laughing last,<BR>
As forth from his bowstring barbed arrows are cast.<BR>
I scoffed at the god with a sneer on my lip,<BR>
And he forces me now from his chalice to sip<BR>
A bitter sweet potion.  Ah, lightly the part<BR>
Of a lover I've played many times, but my heart<BR>
Has been proud in its record of friendship.  And now<BR>
The mad, eager lover born in me must bow<BR>
To the strong claims of friendship.  I love Mabel Lee;<BR>
Dared I woo as I would, I could make her love me.<BR>
The soul of a maid who knows not passion's fire<BR>
Is moth to the flame of a man's strong desire.<BR>
With one kiss on her lips I could banish the nun<BR>
And wake in her virginal bosom the one<BR>
Mighty love of her life.  If I leave her, I know<BR>
She will be my friend's wife in a season or so.<BR>
He loves her, he always has loved her; 'tis he<BR>
Who ever will do all the loving; and she<BR>
Will accept it, and still be the saint to the end,<BR>
And she never will know what she missed; but my friend<BR>
Has the right to speak first.  God! how can he delay?<BR>
I marvel at men who are fashioned that way.<BR>
He has worshiped her since first she put up her tresses,<BR>
And let down the hem of her school-girlish dresses<BR>
And now she is full twenty-two; were I he<BR>
A brood of her children should climb on my knee<BR>
By this time!  What a sin against love to postpone<BR>
The day that might make her forever his own.<BR>
The man who can wait has no blood in his veins.<BR>
Maurice is a dreamer, he loves with his brains<BR>
Not with soul and with senses.  And yet his whole life<BR>
Will be blank if he makes not this woman his wife.<BR>
She is woof of his dreams, she is warp of his mind;<BR>
Who tears her away shall leave nothing behind.<BR>
No, no, I am going: farewell to Bay Bend<BR>
I am no woman's lover&mdash;I <I>am</I> one man's friend.<BR>
Still-born in the arms of the matron eyed year<BR>
Lies the beautiful dream that my life buries here.<BR>
Its tomb was its cradle; it came but to taunt me,<BR>
It died, but its phantom shall ever more haunt me."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
He turned from the waves that leaped at him in wrath<BR>
To find Mabel Lee, like a wraith, in his path.<BR>
The rose from her cheek had departed in fear;<BR>
The tip of her eyelash was gemmed with a tear.<BR>
The rude winds had disarranged mantle and dress,<BR>
And she clung with both hands to her hat in distress.<BR>
"I am frightened," she cried, in a tremulous tone;<BR>
"I dare not proceed any farther alone.<BR>
As I came by the church yard the wind felled a tree,<BR>
And invisible hands seemed to hurl it at me;<BR>
I hurried on, shrieking; the wind, in disgust,<BR>
Tore the hat from my head, filled my eyes full of dust,<BR>
And otherwise made me the butt of its sport.<BR>
Just then I spied you, like a light in the port,<BR>
And I steered for you.  Please do not laugh at my fright!<BR>
I am really quite bold in the calm and the light,<BR>
But when a storm gathers, or darkness prevails,<BR>
My courage deserts me, my bravery fails,<BR>
And I want to hide somewhere and cover my ears,<BR>
And give myself up to weak womanish tears."<BR>

Her ripple of talk allowed Roger Montrose<BR>
A few needed moments to calm and compose<BR>
His excited emotions; to curb and control<BR>
The turbulent feelings that surged through his soul<BR>
At the sudden encounter.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">"I quite understand,"</SPAN><BR>
He said in a voice that was under command<BR>
Of his will, "All your fears in a storm of this kind.<BR>
There is something uncanny and weird in the wind;<BR>
Intangible, viewless, it speeds on its course,<BR>
And forests and oceans must yield to its force.<BR>
What art has constructed with patience and toil,<BR>
The wind in one second of time can despoil.<BR>
It carries destruction and death and despair,<BR>
Yet no man can follow it into its lair<BR>
And bind it or stay it&mdash;this thing without form.<BR>
Ah! there comes the rain! we are caught in the storm.<BR>
Put my coat on your shoulders and come with me where<BR>
Yon rock makes a shelter&mdash;I often sit there<BR>
To watch the great conflicts 'twixt tempest and sea.<BR>
Let me lie at your feet!  'Tis the last time, Miss Lee,<BR>

I leave on the morrow at break o' the day."<BR>

His last words were lost in the loud thunder's crash;<BR>
The sea seemed ablaze with a sulphurous flash.<BR>
From the rocks just above them an evergreen tree<BR>
Was torn up by the roots and flung into the sea.<BR>
The waves with rude arms hurled it back on the shore;<BR>
The wind gained in fury.  The glare and the roar<BR>
Of the lightning and tempest paled Mabel Lee's cheek,<BR>
Her pupils dilated; she sprang with a shriek<BR>
Of a terrified child lost to all save alarm,<BR>
And clasped Roger Montrose with both hands by the arm,<BR>
While her cheek pressed his shoulder.  An agony, sweet<BR>
And unbearable, thrilled from his head to his feet,<BR>
His veins were like rivers, with billows of fire:<BR>
His will lost control; and long fettered desire<BR>
Slipped its leash.  He caught Mabel Lee to his breast,<BR>
Drew her face up to his, on her frightened lips pressed<BR>
Wild caresses of passion that startled and shocked.<BR>
Like a madman he looked, like a madman he talked,<BR>
Waiting not for reply, with no pause but a kiss,<BR>
While his iron arms welded her bosom to his.<BR>
"Girl, girl, you demanded my secret," he cried;<BR>
"Well, that bruise on your lips tells the story!  I tried,<BR>
Good God, how I tried! to be silent and go<BR>
Without speaking one word, without letting you know<BR>
That I loved you; yet how could you look in my eyes<BR>
And not see love was there like the sun in the skies?<BR>
Ah, those hands on my arm&mdash;that dear head lightly pressed<BR>
On my shoulder!  God, woman, the heart in my breast<BR>
Was dry powder, your touch was the spark; and the blame<BR>
Must be yours if both lives are scorched black with the flame.<BR>
Do you hate me, despise me, for being so weak?<BR>
No, no! let me kiss you again ere you speak!<BR>
You are mine for the moment; and mine&mdash;mine alone<BR>
Is the first taste of passion your soft mouth has known.<BR>
Whoever forestalls me in winning your hand,<BR>
Between you and him shall this mad moment stand&mdash;<BR>
You shall think of me, though you think only to hate.<BR>
There&mdash;speak to me&mdash;speak to me&mdash;tell me my fate;<BR>
On your words, Mabel Lee, hangs my whole future life.<BR>
I covet you, covet you, sweet, for my wife;<BR>
I want to stay here at your side.  Since I first<BR>
Saw your face I have felt an unquenchable thirst<BR>
To be good&mdash;to look deep in your eyes and find God,<BR>
And to leave in the past the dark paths I have trod<BR>
In my search after pleasure.  Ah, must I go back<BR>
Into folly again, to retread the old track<BR>
Which leads out into nothingness?  Girl, answer me,<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
In a bare little room of a tenement row<BR>
Of the city, Maurice sat alone.  It was so<BR>
(In this nearness to life's darkest phases of grief<BR>
And despair) that his own bitter woe found relief.<BR>
Joy needs no companion; but sorrow and pain<BR>
Long to comrade with sorrow.  The flowery chain<BR>
Flung by Pleasure about her gay votaries breaks<BR>
With the least strain upon it.  The chain sorrow makes<BR>
Links heart unto heart.  As a bullock will fly<BR>
To far fields when an arrow has pierced him, to die,<BR>
So Maurice had flown over far oceans to find<BR>
No balm for his wounds, and no peace for his mind.<BR>
Cosmopolitan, always, is sorrow; at home<BR>
In all countries and lands, thriving well while we roam<BR>
In vain efforts to slay it.  Toil only, brings peace<BR>
To the tempest tossed heart.  What in travel Maurice<BR>
Failed to find&mdash;self-forgetfulness&mdash;came with his work<BR>
For the suffering poor in the slums of New York.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He had wandered in strange heathen countries&mdash;had been<BR>
Among barbarous hordes; but the greed and the sin<BR>
Of his own native land seemed the shame of the hour.<BR>
In his gold there was balm, in his pen there was power<BR>
To comfort the needy, to aid and defend<BR>
The unfortunate.  Close in their midst, as a friend<BR>
And companion, for more than twelve months he had dwelt.<BR>
Like a ray of pure light in a cellar was felt<BR>
This strong, wholesome presence.  His little room bare<BR>
Of all luxuries, taught the poor souls who flocked there<BR>
For his counsel and aid, how by mere cleanliness<BR>
The grim features of want lose some lines of distress.<BR>
The slips from the plants on his window ledge, given<BR>
To beauty starved souls, spoke more clearly of heaven<BR>
And God than did sermons or dry creedy tracts.<BR>
Maurice was no preacher; and yet his kind acts<BR>
Of mercy and self-immolation sufficed<BR>
To wake in dark minds a bright image of Christ&mdash;<BR>
The Christ often heard of, but doubted before.<BR>
Maurice spoke no word of religion.  Of yore<BR>
His heart had accepted the creeds of his youth<BR>
Without pausing to cavil, or question their truth.<BR>
Faith seemed his inheritance.  But, with the blow<BR>
Which slew love and killed friendship, faith, too, seemed to go.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It is easy to be optimistic in pleasure,<BR>
But when Pain stands us up by her portal to measure<BR>
The actual height of our trust and belief,<BR>
Ah! then is the time when our faith comes to grief.<BR>
The woes of our fellows, God sends them, 'tis plain;<BR>
But the devil himself is the cause of <I>our</I> pain.<BR>
We question the wisdom that rules o'er the world,<BR>
And our minds into chaos and darkness are hurled.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The average scoffer at faith goes about<BR>
Pouring into the ears of his fellows each doubt<BR>
Which assails him.  One truth he fails wholly to heed;<BR>
That a doubt oft repeated may bore like a creed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Maurice kept his thoughts to himself, but his pen<BR>
Was dipped in the gall of his heart now and then,<BR>
And his muse was the mouthpiece.  The sin unforgiven<BR>
I hold by the Cherubim chanting in heaven<BR>
Is the sin of the poet who dares sing a strain<BR>
Which adds to the world's awful chorus of pain<BR>
And repinings.  The souls whom the gods bless at birth<BR>
With the great gift of song, have been sent to the earth<BR>
To better and brighten it.  Woe to the heart<BR>
Which lets its own sorrow embitter its art.<BR>
Unto him shall more sorrow be given; and life<BR>
After life filled with sorrow, till, spent with the strife,<BR>
He shall cease from rebellion, and bow to the rod<BR>
In submission, and own and acknowledge his God.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Maurice, with his unwilling muse in the gloom<BR>
Of a mood pessimistic, was shut in his room.<BR>
A whistle, a step on the stairway, a knock,<BR>
Then over the transom there fluttered a flock<BR>
Of white letters.  The Muse, with a sigh of content,<BR>
Left the poet to read them, and hurriedly went<BR>
Back to pleasanter regions.  Maurice glanced them through:<BR>
There were brief business epistles from two<BR>
Daily papers, soliciting work from his pen;<BR>
A woman begged money for Christ's sake; three men<BR>
Asked employment; a mother wrote only to say<BR>
How she blessed him and prayed God to bless him each day<BR>
For his kindness to her and to hers; and the last<BR>
Was a letter from Ruth.  The pale ghost of the past<BR>
Rose out of its poor shallow grave, with the scent<BR>
And the mold of the clay clinging to it, and leant<BR>
O'er Maurice as he read, while its breath fanned his cheek.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Forgive me," wrote Ruth; "for at last I must speak<BR>
Of the two whom you wish to forget.  Well I know<BR>
How you suffered, still suffer, from fate's sudden blow,<BR>
Though I am a woman, and women must stay<BR>
And fight out pain's battles where men run away.<BR>
But my strength has its limit, my courage its end,<BR>
The time has now come when I, too, leave Bay Bend.<BR>
Maurice, let the bitterness housed in your heart<BR>
For the man you long loved as a comrade, depart,<BR>
And let pity replace it.  Oh, weep for his sorrow&mdash;<BR>
From your fountain of grief, held in check, let me borrow;<BR>
I have so overdrawn on the bank of my tears<BR>
That my anguish is now refused payment.  For years<BR>
You loved Mabel Lee.  Well, to some hearts love speaks<BR>
His whole tale of passion in brief little weeks.<BR>
As Minerva, full grown, from the great brow of Jove<BR>
Sprang to life, so full blown from our breasts may spring Love.<BR>
Love hid like a bee in my heart's lily cup;<BR>
I knew not he was there till his sting woke me up.<BR>

Maurice, oh Maurice!  Can you fancy the woe<BR>
Of seeing the prize which you coveted so<BR>
Misused, or abused, by another?  The wife<BR>
Of the man whom I worshiped is spoiling the life<BR>
That was wax in her hands, wax to shape as she chose.<BR>
You were blind to her faults, so was Roger Montrose.<BR>
Both saw but the saint; well, let saints keep their places,<BR>
And not crowd the women in life's hurried races.<BR>
As saint, Mabel Lee might succeed; but, oh brother,<BR>
She never was meant for a wife or a mother.<BR>
Her beautiful home has the desolate air<BR>
Of a house that is ruled by its servants.  The care&mdash;<BR>
The thought of the <I>woman</I> (that sweet, subtle power<BR>
Pervading some rooms like the scent of a flower),<BR>
Which turns house into home&mdash;<I>that</I> is lacking.  She goes<BR>
On her merciful rounds, does our Lady Montrose,<BR>
Looking after the souls of the heathen, and leaving<BR>
The poor hungry soul of her lord to its grieving.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
He craves her companionship; wants her to be<BR>
At his side, more his own, than the public's.  But she<BR>
Holds such love is but selfish; and thinks he should make<BR>
Some sacrifice gladly for charity's sake.<BR>
Her schools, and her clubs, and her fairs fill her time;<BR>
He wants her to travel; no, that were a crime<BR>
To go seeking for pleasure, and leave duty here.<BR>
God had given her work and her labor lay near.<BR>
A month of the theater season in town?<BR>
No, the stage is an evil that needs putting down<BR>
By good people.  So, scheme as he will, the poor man<BR>
Has to finally yield every project and plan<BR>
To this sweet stubborn saint; for the husband, you see,<BR>
Stands last in Her thoughts.  He has come, after three<BR>
Patient years, to that knowledge; his wishes, his needs<BR>
Must always give way to her whims, or her creeds.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
She knows not the primer of loving; her soul<BR>
Is engrossed with the poor petty wish to <I>control</I>.<BR>
And she chafes at restriction.  Love loves to be bound,<BR>
And its sweetest of freedom in bondage is found.<BR>
She pulls at her fetters.  One worshiping heart<BR>
And its faithful devotion play but a small part<BR>
In her life.  She would rather be lauded and praised<BR>
By a crowd of inferior followers, raised<BR>
To the pitiful height of their leader, than be<BR>
One man's goddess.  There, now, is the true Mabel Lee!<BR>
Grieve not that you lost her, but grieve for the one<BR>
Who with me stood last night by the corpse of his son,<BR>
And with me stood alone.  Ah! how wisely and well<BR>
Could Mabel descant on Maternity! tell<BR>
Other women the way to train children to be<BR>
An honor and pride to their parents!  Yet she,<BR>
From the first, left her child to the nurses.  She found<BR>
'Twas a tax on her nerves to have baby around<BR>
When it worried and cried.  The nurse knew what to do,<BR>
And a block down the street lived Mama! 'twixt the two<BR>
Little Roger would surely be cared for.  She must<BR>
Keep her strength and be worthy the love and the trust<BR>
Of the poor, who were yearly increasing, and not<BR>
Bestow on her own all the care and the thought&mdash;<BR>
That were selfishness, surely.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">Well, the babe grew apace,</SPAN><BR>
But yesterday morning a flush on its face<BR>
And a look in its eye worried Roger.  The mother<BR>
Was due at some sort of convention or other<BR>
In Boston&mdash;I think 'twas a grand federation<BR>
Of clubs formed by women to rescue the Nation<BR>
From man's awful clutches; and Mabel was made<BR>
The head delegate of the Bay Bend Brigade.<BR>
Once drop in a small, selfish nature the seed<BR>
Of ambition for place, and it grows like a weed.<BR>
The fair village angel we called Mabel Lee,<BR>
As Mrs. Montrose, has developed, you see,<BR>
To a full fledged Reformer.  It quite turned her head<BR>
To be sent to the city of beans and brown bread<BR>
As a delegate!  (Delegate! magical word!<BR>
The heart of the queer modern woman is stirred<BR>
Far more by its sound than by aught she may hear<BR>
In the phrases poor Cupid pours into her ear.)<BR>
Mabel chirped to the baby a dozen good-byes,<BR>
And laughed at the trouble in Roger's grave eyes,<BR>
As she leaned o'er the lace ruffled crib of her son<BR>
And talked baby-talk: "Now be good, 'ittle one,<BR>
While Mama is away, and don't draw a long breath,<BR>
Unless 'oo would worry Papa half to death.<BR>
And don't cough, and, of all things, don't <I>sneeze</I>, 'ittle dear,<BR>
Or Papa will be thrown into spasms of fear.<BR>
Now, good-bye, once again, 'ittle man; mother knows<BR>
There is no other baby like Roger Montrose<BR>
In the whole world to-day."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">So she left him.  That night</SPAN><BR>

No ambition beyond being loyal and true,<BR>

The love and the <I>comfort</I> my woman's heart stored<BR>
In its depths for his taking, and sought Mabel Lee.<BR>
Well, I'm done with the role of the housewife.  I see<BR>
There is nothing in being domestic.  The part<BR>

Keen pity for all she had suffered.  "Poor Ruth,<BR>

He mused, "how the pure soul of sweet Mabel Lee<BR>
Revolts at the bondage and shrinks from the ban<BR>
That lies in the love of that sensual man.<BR>
He is of the earth, earthy.  He loves but her beauty,<BR>
He cares not for conscience, or honor or duty.<BR>
Like a moth she was dazzled and lured by the flame<BR>
Of a light she thought love, till she learned its true name;<BR>
When she found it mere passion, it lost all its charms.<BR>
No wonder she flies from his fettering arms!<BR>
God pity you, Mabel! poor ill mated wife;<BR>
But my love, like a planet, shall watch o'er your life,<BR>
Though all other light from your skies disappear,<BR>

Wooed, wedded and widowed ere twenty.  The life<BR>
Of Zoe Travers is told in that sentence.  A wife<BR>
For one year, loved and loving; so full of life's joy<BR>
That death, growing jealous, resolved to destroy<BR>
The Eden she dwelt in.  Five desolate years<BR>
She walked robed in weeds, and bathed ever in tears,<BR>
Through the valley of memory.  Locked in love's tomb<BR>
Lay youth in its glory and hope in its bloom.<BR>
At times she was filled with religious devotion,<BR>
Again crushed to earth with rebellious emotion<BR>
And unresigned sorrow.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">Ah, wild was her grief!</SPAN><BR>
And the years seemed to bring her no balm of relief.<BR>
When a heart from its sorrow time cannot estrange,<BR>
God sends it another to alter and change<BR>
The current of feeling.  Zoe's mother, her one<BR>
Tie to earth, became ill.  When the doctors had done<BR>
All the harm which they dared do with powder and pill,<BR>
They ordered a trial of Dame Nature's skill.<BR>
Dear Nature! what grief in her bosom must stir<BR>
When she sees us turn everywhere save unto her<BR>
For the health she holds always in keeping; and sees<BR>
Us at last, when too late, creeping back to her knees,<BR>
Begging that she at first could have given!<BR>

Mother Nature's heart grieved o'er the mother of Zoe,<BR>
Who came but to die on her bosom.  She died<BR>
Where the mocking bird poured out its passionate tide<BR>
Of lush music; and all through the dark days of pain<BR>
That succeeded, and over and through the refrain<BR>
Of her sorrow, Zoe heard that wild song evermore.<BR>
It seemed like a blow which pushed open a door<BR>
In her heart.  Something strange, sweet and terrible stirred<BR>
In her nature, aroused by the song of that bird.<BR>
It rang like a voice from the future; a call<BR>
That came not from the past; yet the past held her all.<BR>
To the past she had plighted her vows; in the past<BR>
Lay her one dream of happiness, first, only, last.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Alone in the world now, she felt the unrest<BR>
Of an unanchored boat on the wild billow's breast.<BR>
Two homes had been shattered; the West held but tombs.<BR>
She drifted again where the magnolia blooms<BR>
And the mocking bird sings.  Oh! that song, that wild strain,<BR>
Whose echoes still haunted her heart and her brain!<BR>
How she listened to hear it repeated!  It came<BR>
Through the dawn to her heart, and the sound was like flame.<BR>
It chased all the shadows of night from her room,<BR>
And burst the closed bud of the day into bloom.<BR>
It leaped to the heavens, it sank to the earth<BR>
It gave life new rapture and love a new birth.<BR>

The call of a bird in the spring for its lover<BR>

Grief's winter was over, the snows from her heart<BR>
Were melted; hope's blossoms were ready to start.<BR>
The spring had returned with its siren delights,<BR>
And her youth and emotions asserted their rights.<BR>
Then memory struggled with passion.  The dead<BR>
Seemed to rise from the grave and accuse her.  She fled<BR>
From her thoughts as from lepers; returned to old ways,<BR>
And strove to keep occupied, filling her days<BR>
With devotional duties.  But when the night came<BR>
She heard through her slumber that song like a flame,<BR>
And her dreams were sweet torture.  She sought all too soon<BR>
To chill the warm sun of her youth's ardent noon<BR>
With the shadows of premature evening.  Her mind<BR>
Lacked direction and purpose.  She tried in a blind,<BR>
Groping fashion to follow an early ideal<BR>
Of love and of constancy, starving the real<BR>
Affectional nature God gave her.  She prayed<BR>
For God's help in unmaking the woman He made,<BR>
As if He repented the thing He had done.<BR>
With the soul of a Sappho, she lived like a nun,<BR>
Hid her thoughts from all women, from men kept apart,<BR>
And carefully guarded the book of her heart<BR>
From the world's prying eyes.  Yet men read through the cover,<BR>
And knew that the story was food for a lover.<BR>
(The dullest of men seemed possessed of the art<BR>
To read what the passions inscribe on the heart.<BR>
Though written in cipher and sealed from the sight,<BR>
Yet masculine eyes will interpret aright.)<BR>
Worn out with the unceasing conflict at last,<BR>
Zoe fled from herself and her sorrowful past,<BR>
And turned to new scenes for diversion from thought.<BR>

New York! oh, what magic encircles that spot<BR>
In the feminine mind of the West!  There, it seems,<BR>

There the waters of Lethe unceasingly roll,<BR>
With blessed forgetfulness free to each soul,<BR>
While the doorways that lead to success open wide,<BR>
With Fame in the distance to beckon and guide.<BR>
Mirth lurks in each byway, and Folly herself<BR>
Wears the look of a semi-respectable elf,<BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">It was so,</SPAN><BR>
Since she first heard the name of the city, that Zoe<BR>
Dreamed of life in New York.  It was thither she turned<BR>
To smother the heart that with restlessness burned,<BR>
And to quiet and calm an unsatisfied mind.<BR>
Her plans were but outlines, crude, vague, undefined,<BR>
Of distraction and pleasure.  A snug little home,<BR>
With seclusion and comfort; full freedom to roam<BR>
Where her fancy and income permitted; new faces,<BR>
New scenes, new environments, far from the places<BR>
Where brief joy and long sorrow had dwelt with her; free<BR>
From the curious eyes that seemed ever to be<BR>
Bent upon her.  She passed like a ship from the port,<BR>
Without chart or compass; the plaything and sport<BR>
Of the billows of Fate.<BR>

And busy with costuming duties of May<BR>
When Zoe reached New York.  The rain and the breeze<BR>
Had freshened the gowns of the Northern pine trees<BR>
Till they looked bright as new; all the willows were seen<BR>
In soft dainty garments of exquisite green.<BR>
Young buds swelled with life, and reached out to invite<BR>
And to hold the warm gaze of the wandering light.<BR>
The turf exhaled fragrance; among the green boughs<BR>
The unabashed city birds plighted their vows,<BR>
Or happy young house hunters chirped of the best<BR>
And most suitable nook to establish a nest.<BR>

There was love in the sunshine, and love in the air;<BR>
Youth, hope, home, companionship, spring, everywhere.<BR>

In all the great city, seemed loveless and lonely.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The trim little flat, facing north on the park,<BR>
Was not homelike; the rooms seemed too sombre and dark<BR>
To her eyes, sun-accustomed; the neighbors too near<BR>
And too noisy.  The medley of sounds hurt her ear.<BR>
Sudden laughter; the cry of an infant; the splash<BR>
Of a tenant below in his bath-tub; the crash<BR>
Of strong hands on a keyboard above, and the light,<BR>
Merry voice of the lady who lived opposite,<BR>
The air intertwined in a tangled sound ball,<BR>
And flung straight at her ear through the court and the hall.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Ah, what loneliness dwelt in the rush and the stir<BR>
Of the great pushing throngs that were nothing to her,<BR>
And to whom she was nothing!  Her heart, on its quest<BR>
For distraction, seemed eating itself in her breast.<BR>
She longed for a comrade, a friend.  In the church<BR>
Which she frequented no one abetted her search,<BR>
For the faces of people she met in its aisle<BR>
Gazed calmly beyond her, without glance or smile.<BR>
The look in their eyes, when translated, read thus,<BR>
"We worship God here, what are people to us?"<BR>
In some masculine eyes she read more, it is true.<BR>
What she read made her gaze at the floor of her pew.<BR>

The blithe little blonde who lived over the hall,<BR>
In the opposite rooms, was the first one to call<BR>
Or to show friendly feeling.  She seemed sweet and kind,<BR>

Her voice had the timbre of metal.  Each word<BR>
Clinked each word like small change in a purse; and you heard,<BR>
In the rustling silk of her skirts, just a hint<BR>
Of new bills freshly printed and right from the mint.<BR>

There was that in her airs and her chatter which made<BR>
Zoe question and ponder, and turn half afraid<BR>
From her proffers of friendship.  When one July day<BR>
The fair neighbor called for a moment to say,<BR>
"I am off to Long Branch for the summer, good-bye,"<BR>
Zoe seemed to breathe freer&mdash;she scarcely knew why,<BR>
But she reasoned it out as alone in the gloom<BR>
Of the soft summer evening she sat in her room.<BR>
"The woman is happy," she said; "at the least,<BR>
Her heart is not starving in life's ample feast.<BR>
She lives while she lives, but I only exist,<BR>
And Fate laughs in my face for the things I resist."<BR>

New York in the midsummer seems like the gay<BR>
Upper servant who rules with the mistress away.<BR>
She entertains friends from all parts of the earth;<BR>
Her streets are alive with a fictitious mirth.<BR>
She flaunts her best clothes with a devil-may-care<BR>
Sort of look, and her parks wear a riotous air.<BR>
There is something unwholesome about her at dusk;<BR>
Her trees, and her gardens, seem scented with musk;<BR>
And you feel she has locked up the door of the house<BR>
And, half drunk with the heat, wanders forth to carouse,<BR>
With virtue, ambition and industry all<BR>
Packed off (moth-protected) with garments for Fall.<BR>

Zoe felt out of step with the town.  In the song<BR>
Which it sang, where each note was a soul of the throng,<BR>
She seemed the one discord.  Books gave no distraction.<BR>
She cared not for study, her heart longed for action,<BR>
For pleasure, excitement.  Wild impulses, new<BR>
To her mind, came like demons and urged her to do<BR>
All sorts of mad things.  Mischief breathed through the air.<BR>
One could do as one liked in New York&mdash;who would care&mdash;<BR>
Who would know save the God who had left her alone<BR>
In his world, unprotected, unloved?  From her own<BR>
Restless mind and sick heart she attempted once more<BR>
To escape.  One reads much of gay life at the shore&mdash;<BR>
Narragansett, she fancied, would suit her.  The sea<BR>
Would at least prove a friend; and, perchance, there might be<BR>
Some heart, like her own, seeking comradeship there.<BR>
The days brought no friend.  But the moist, salty air<BR>
Was a stimulant, giving existence new charms.<BR>
The sea was a lover who opened his arms<BR>
Every day to embrace her.  And life in this place<BR>
Held something of pleasure, and sweetness and grace,<BR>
Though the eyes of the men were too ardent and bold,<BR>
And the eyes of the women suspicious and cold,<BR>
She yet had the sea&mdash;the sea, strong and mighty,<BR>
Both father and mother of fair Aphrodite.<BR>

The beach swarmed with bathers&mdash;to be more exact,<BR>
Swarmed with people in costumes of bathers.  In fact,<BR>
Many beautiful women bathed but in the light<BR>
Of men's eyes; and their costumes were made for the sight,<BR>
Not the sea.  From the sea's lusty outreaching arms<BR>
They escaped with shrill shrieks, while the men viewed their charms<BR>
And made mental notes of them.  Yet, at this hour,<BR>
The waves, too, were swelling sea meadows, a-flower<BR>
With faces of swimmers.  All dressed for his bath,<BR>
Roger paused in confusion, because in his path<BR>
Surged a crowd of the curious; all eyes were bent<BR>
On the form of a woman who leisurely went<BR>
From her bathing house down to the beach.  "There she goes,"<BR>
Roger heard a dame cry, as she stepped on his toes<BR>
With her whole ample weight.  "What, the one with red hair?<BR>
Why, she isn't as pretty as Maude, I declare."<BR>
A man passing by with his comrade, cried: "Ned,<BR>
Look! there is La Travers, the one with the red<BR>
Braid of hair to her knees.  She's a mystery here,<BR>
And at present the topic of talk at the Pier."<BR>
Roger followed their glances in time to behold<BR>
For a second a head crowned with braids of bright gold,<BR>
And a form like a Venus, all costumed in white.<BR>
Then she plunged through a billow and vanished from sight.<BR>

It was half an hour afterward, possibly more,<BR>
As Roger swam farther and farther from shore,<BR>
With new life in his limbs and new force in his brain,<BR>
That he heard, just behind him, a sharp cry of pain.<BR>
Ten strokes in the rear on the crest of a wave<BR>
Shone a woman's white face.  "Keep your courage; be brave;<BR>
I am coming," he shouted.  "Turn over and float."<BR>
His strong shoulder plunged like the prow of a boat<BR>
Through the billows.  Six overhand strokes brought him close<BR>
To the woman, who lay like a wilted white rose<BR>
On the waves.  "Now, be careful," he cried; "lay your hand<BR>
Well up on my shoulder; my arms, understand,<BR>
Must be free; do not touch them&mdash;-please follow my wishes,<BR>
Unless you are anxious to fatten the fishes."<BR>
The woman obeyed him.  "You need not fear me,"<BR>
She replied, "I am wholly at home in the sea.<BR>
I knew all the arts of the swimmer, I thought,<BR>
But confess I was frightened when suddenly caught<BR>
With a cramp in my knee at this distance from shore."<BR>
With slow even breast strokes the strong swimmer bore<BR>
His fair burden landward.  She lay on the billows<BR>
As lightly as if she were resting on pillows<BR>
Of down.  She relinquished herself to the sea<BR>
And the man, and was saved; though God knows both can be<BR>
False and fickle enough; yet resistance or strife,<BR>
On occasions like this, means the forfeit of life.<BR>
The throng of the bathers had scattered before<BR>
Roger carried his burden safe into the shore<BR>
And saw her emerge from the water, a place<BR>
Where most women lose every vestige of grace<BR>
Or of charm.  But this mermaid seemed fairer than when<BR>
She had challenged the glances of women and men<BR>
As she went to her bath.  Now her clinging silk suit<BR>
Revealed every line, from the throat to the foot,<BR>
Of her beautiful form.  Her arms, in their splendor,<BR>
Gleamed white like wet marble.  The round waist was slender,<BR>
And yet not too small.  From the twin perfect crests<BR>
And the virginlike grace of her beautiful breasts<BR>
To the exquisite limbs and the curve of her thigh,<BR>
And the arch of her proud little instep, the eye<BR>
Drank in beauty.  Her face was not beautiful; yet<BR>
The gaze lingered on it, for Eros had set<BR>
His seal on her features.  The mouth full and weak,<BR>
The blue shadow drooping from eyelid to cheek<BR>
Like a stain of crushed grapes, and the pale, ardent skin,<BR>
All spoke of volcanic emotions within.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
By her tip tilted nose and low brow, it was plain<BR>
To read how her impulses ruled o'er her brain.<BR>
She had given the chief role of life to her heart,<BR>
And her intellect played but a small minor part.<BR>
Her eyes were the color the sunlight reveals<BR>
When it pierces the soft, furry coat of young seals.<BR>
The thickly fringed lids seemed unwilling to rise,<BR>
But drooped, half concealing them; wonderful eyes,<BR>
Full of secrets and bodings of sorrow.  As coarse<BR>
And as thick as the mane of a finely groomed horse<BR>
Was her bright mass of hair.  The sea, with rough hands,<BR>
Had made free with the braids, and unloosened the strands<BR>
Till they hung in great clusters of curls to her knees.<BR>
Her voice, when she spoke, held the breadth and the breeze<BR>
Of the West in its tones; and the use of the <I>R</I><BR>
Made the listener certain her home had been far<BR>
From New England.  Long after she vanished from view<BR>
The eye and the ear seemed to sense her anew.<BR>
There was that in her voice and her presence which hung<BR>
In the air like a strain of a song which is sung<BR>
By a singer, and then sings itself the whole day,<BR>
And will hot be silenced.<BR>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">As birds flock away</SPAN><BR>
From meadow to tree branch, now there and now here,<BR>
So, from beach to Casino, each day at the Pier<BR>
Flock the gay pleasure seekers.  The balconies glow<BR>
With beauty and color.  The belle and the beau<BR>
Promenade in the sunlight, or sit tete-a-tete,<BR>
While the chaperons gossip together.  Bands play,<BR>
Glasses clink; and 'neath sheltering lace parasols<BR>
There are plans made for meeting at drives or at balls.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Roger gat at a table alone, with his glass<BR>
Of mint julep before him, and watched the crowd pass.<BR>
There were all sorts of people from all sorts of places.<BR>
He thought he liked best the fair Baltimore faces.<BR>
The South was the land of fair women, he mused,<BR>
Because they were indolent.  Women who used<BR>
Mind or body too freely.  Changed curves into angles,<BR>
For beauty forever with intellect wrangles.<BR>
The trend of the fair sex to-day must alarm<BR>
Every lover of feminine beauty and charm.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
As he mused Roger watched with a keen interest<BR>
For a sight of his Undine.  "All coiffured and drest,<BR>
With her wonderful body concealed, and her hair<BR>
Knotted up, well, I doubt if she seem even fair,"<BR>
He soliloquized.  "Ah!" the word burst from his lips,<BR>
For he saw her approaching.  She walked from the hips<BR>
With an undulous motion.  As graceful and free<BR>
From all effort as waves swinging in from the sea<BR>
Were her movements.  Her full molded figure seemed slight<BR>
In its close fitting gown of black cloth; and the white<BR>
Of her cheek seemed still whiter by contrast.  Her clothes<BR>
Were tasteful and quiet; yet Roger Montrose<BR>
Knew in some subtle manner he could not express<BR>
('Tis an instinct men have in the matters of dress)<BR>
That they never were made in New York.  By her hat<BR>
One can oft read a woman's whole character.  That<BR>
Which our fair Undine wore was a thing of rich lace,<BR>
Flowers and ribbons like others one saw in the place.<BR>
Yet the width of the brim, or the twist of its bows,<BR>
Or the way it was worn made it different from those.<BR>
As it drooped o'er the eyes full of mystery there,<BR>
It seemed, all at once, both a menace and dare;<BR>
A menace to women, a dare to the men.<BR>
She bowed as she passed Roger's table; and then<BR>
Took a chair opposite, spread her shade of red silk,<BR>
Called a waiter and ordered a cup of hot milk,<BR>
Which she leisurely sipped.  She seemed unaware<BR>
Of the curious eyes she attracted.  Her air<BR>
Was of one quite at home, and entirely at ease<BR>
With herself, the sole person she studied to please.<BR>
She had been for three weeks at the Pier, and alone,<BR>
Without maid or escort, and nothing was known<BR>
Of her there, save the name which the register bore,<BR>
"Mrs. Travers, New York."  Men were mad to learn more<BR>
But the women were distant.  One can't, at such places,<BR>
Accept as credentials good figures or faces.<BR>
There was an unnameable <I>something</I> about<BR>
Mrs. Travers which filled other women with doubt<BR>
And all men with interest.  Roger, blasé,<BR>
Disillusioned with life as he was, felt the sway<BR>
Of her strong personality, there as she sat<BR>
Looking out 'neath the rim of her coquettish hat<BR>
With dark eyes on the sea.  Few people had power<BR>
To draw his gray thoughts from himself for an hour<BR>
As this woman had done; she was food for his mind,<BR>
And he sought by his inner perceptions to find<BR>
in what class she belonged.  "An adventuress?  No,<BR>
Though I fancy three-fourths of the women think so<BR>
And one-half of the men; but that role leaves a trace,<BR>
An expression, I fail to detect in her face.<BR>
Her past is not shadowed; my judgment would say<BR>
That her sins lie before her, and not far away.<BR>
She's a puzzle, I think, to herself; and grim Fate<BR>
Will aid her in solving the riddle too late.<BR>
Her soul dreams of happiness; but in her eyes<BR>
The sensuous foe to all happiness lies.<BR>
As the rain is drawn up by some moods of the sun,<BR>
Some natures draw trouble from life; her's is one."<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
She rose and passed by him again, and her gown<BR>
Brushed his knee.  A light tremor went shivering down<BR>
His whole body.  She left on the air as she went<BR>
A subtle suggestion of perfume; the scent<BR>
Which steals out of some fans, or old laces, and seems<BR>
Full of soft fragrant fancies and languorous dreams.<BR>
She haunted the mind, though she passed from the sight.<BR>
When Roger Montrose sought his pillow that night,<BR>
'Twas to dream of La Travers.  He thought she became<BR>
A burning red rose, with each leaf like a flame.<BR>
He stooped down and plucked it, and woke with a start,<BR>
As it turned to an adder and struck at his heart.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The dream left its impress, as certain dreams should,<BR>
For, as warnings of evil, precursors of good,<BR>

Night messages, couched in a cipher divine.<BR>

Roger knew much of life, much of women, and knew<BR>
Even more of himself and his weaknesses.  Few<BR>

While the rest of the world watches us.<BR>

Undeveloped; the second, firm jointed and long,<BR>
Which showed that the reasoning powers were strong,<BR>
But the will, from disuse, had grown feeble.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">That morning</SPAN><BR>
He looked on his dream in the light of a warning<BR>

Of a woman, can do under midsummer skies<BR>
With a man who is wretched as I am.  Unrest<BR>
Is a tramp, who goes picking the locks on one's breast<BR>
That a whole gang of vices may enter.  A thirst<BR>
For strong drink and chance games, those twin comrades accursed,<BR>
Are already admitted.  Oh Mabel, my wife,<BR>
Reach, reach out your arms, draw me into the life<BR>
That alone is worth living.  I need you to-day,<BR>
Have pity, and love me, oh love me, I pray.<BR>
I will turn once again from the bad world to you.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through what are called accidents, Roger was late<BR>
At the train.  Are not accidents servants of Fate?<BR>
The first coach was filled; he passed on to the second.<BR>
That, too, seemed complete, but a gentleman beckoned<BR>
And said, "There's a seat, sir; the third from the last<BR>
On your left."  Roger thanked him and leisurely passed<BR>
Down the aisle, with his coat on his arm, to the place<BR>
Indicated.  The seat held a lady, whose face<BR>
Was turned to the window.  "Pray pardon me, miss"<BR>
(For he judged by her back she was youthful), "is this<BR>
Seat engaged?"  As he spoke, the face turned in surprise,<BR>
And Roger looked into the long, languid eyes<BR>
Of La Travers.  She smiled, moved her wraps from the seat,<BR>
And he sat down beside her.  The same subtle, sweet<BR>
Breath of perfume exhaled from her presence, and made<BR>
The place seem a boudoir.  The deep winey shade<BR>
'Neath her eyes had grown larger, as if she had wept<BR>
Or a late, lonely vigil with memory kept.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
A man who has rescued a woman from danger<BR>
Or death, does not seem to her wholly a stranger<BR>
When next she encounters him; yet both essayed<BR>
To be formal and proper; and each of them made<BR>
The effort a failure.  The jar of a train<BR>
At times holds a mesmeric spell for the brain<BR>
And a tense excitation for nerves; and the shriek<BR>
Of the engine compels one to lean near to speak<BR>
Or to list to his neighbor.  Formality flies<BR>
With the smoke of the train and floats off to the skies.<BR>
Roger led his companion to talk; and the theme<BR>
Which he chose, was herself, her life story.  The dream<BR>
Of the previous night was forgotten.  The charm<BR>
Of the woman outweighed superstitious alarm.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the sunlight began to play peek-a-boo<BR>
Through the tunnels, which told them the journey was through,<BR>
Roger looked at his time-piece; the train for Bay Bend<BR>
Left in just twenty minutes; but what a rude end<BR>
To the day's pleasant comradeship&mdash;rushing away<BR>
With a hurried good-bye!  He decided to stay<BR>
Over night in the city.  He was not expected<BR>
At home.  Mrs. Travers was quite unprotected,<BR>
And almost a stranger in Gotham.  He ought<BR>
To see her safe into her doorway, he thought.<BR>
At the doorway she gave him her hand, with a smile;<BR>
"I have known you," she said, "such a brief little while,<BR>
Yet you seem like a friend of long standing; I say<BR>
Good-bye with reluctance."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">"Perhaps, then, I may</SPAN><BR>
Call and see you to-morrow?" the words seemed to fall<BR>
Of themselves from his lips; words he longed to recall<BR>
When once uttered, for deep in his conscience he knew<BR>
That the one word for him to speak now, was adieu.<BR>
The lady's soft, cushion-like hand rested still<BR>
In his own, and the contact was pleasant.  A thrill<BR>
From the finger tips quickened his pulses.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">"You may</SPAN><BR>

And left his palm lonely.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">"The call must be brief,"</SPAN><BR>
He said to himself, with a sense of relief,<BR>
As he ran down the steps, "for at five my train goes."<BR>
Yet the five o'clock train bore no Roger Montrose<BR>
From New York.  Mrs. Travers had asked him to dine.<BR>
A tete-a-tete dinner with beauty and wine,<BR>
To stir the man's senses and deaden his brain.<BR>
(The devil keeps always good chefs in his train.)<BR>
It was ten when he rose for departure.  The room<BR>
Seemed a garden of midsummer fragrance and bloom.<BR>
The lights with their soft rosy coverings made<BR>
A glow like late sunsets, in some tropic glade.<BR>
The world seemed afar, with its dullness and duty,<BR>
And life was a rapture of love and of beauty.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
God knows how it happened; they never knew how.<BR>
He turned with a formal conventional bow,<BR>
And some well chosen words of politeness, to go.<BR>
Her mouth was a rose Love had dropped in the snow<BR>
Of her face.  It smiled up to him, luscious and sweet.<BR>
In the tip of each finger he felt his heart beat,<BR>
Like five hearts all in one, as her hand touched his own.<BR>
She murmured "good-night," in a tremulous tone.<BR>
White, intense, through the soft golden mist which the wine<BR>
Had cast over his vision, he saw her face shine.<BR>
Her low lidded eyes held a lion-like glow.<BR>
You have seen sudden storms lash the ocean?  You know<BR>
How the cyclone, unheralded, rises in wrath,<BR>
And leaves devastation and death in its path?<BR>
So swift, sudden passion may rise in its power,<BR>
And ruin and blight a whole life in an hour.<BR>
Two unanchored souls in its maelstrom were whirled,<BR>
Drawn down by love's undertow, lost to the world.<BR>
The dark, solemn billows of night shut them in.<BR>
Like corpses afloat on the ocean of sin<BR>
They must seem to their true, better selves, when again<BR>
The tide drifts them back to the notice of men.<BR>

I break through the silence of years, my old friend,<BR>
To beg for a favor; oh, grant it!  I send<BR>
Roger's letter in confidence to you, and ask,<BR>
In the name of our sweet early friendship, a task,<BR>
Which, however painful, I pray you perform.<BR>
Poor Roger! his bark is adrift in the storm.<BR>
He has veered from the course; with no compass of faith<BR>
To point to the harbor, he goes to his death.<BR>
You are giving your talents and time, I am told,<BR>
To aiding the poor; let this victim of gold<BR>
Be included.  His life has not learned self-control,<BR>
And luxury stunted the growth of his soul.<BR>
In blindness of spirit he took the wrong track,<BR>
But he sees his great error and longs to come back.<BR>
Oh, help me to reach him and save him, Maurice.<BR>
My heart yearns to show him the infinite peace<BR>
Found but in God's love.  Let us pity, forgive<BR>
And help him, dear friend, to seek Christ and to live<BR>
In the light of His mercy.  I know you will do<BR>

Your wish shall be ever my pleasure.  I go<BR>

This effort to find him.  Sometimes, I contend,<BR>
It is kinder to let a soul speed to the end<BR>
Of its swift downward course than to check it to-day,<BR>
But to see it to-morrow pursue the same way.<BR>
The man who could wantonly stray from your side<BR>
Into folly and sin has abandoned all pride.<BR>
There is little to hope from him.  Yet, since his name<BR>

The search for your husband is finished.  Oh, pray<BR>
Tear all love and all hope from your heart ere I say<BR>
What I must say.  The man has insulted your trust;<BR>

And ruined the fame of a woman who wore,<BR>
Until now, a good name.  He has gone.  Close the door<BR>

The sleuth hounds of justice were put on his track,<BR>

A widow, young, fair, well-connected.  I hear<BR>

My letter sounds brutal and harsh.  Would to God<BR>

In matters like this the one thing is to know<BR>
The whole truth, and at once.  Though the pain be intense<BR>
It pulls less on the soul than the pangs of suspense.<BR>

Came to Mabel Montrose that her own life was not<BR>
Free from blame.  (How few women, indeed, think of this<BR>

Against Fate for the blow it had dealt to her pride<BR>

It is one thing, of course, for a wife to be slighted<BR>
For the average folly the world calls a sin,<BR>

The matter assumes a new color, and Mabel,<BR>
Who dearly loved sinners, at first seemed unable<BR>
To pardon, or ask God to pardon, the crime<BR>
Of her husband; an angry disgust for a time<BR>
Drove all charity out of her heart.  For a thief,<BR>
For a forger, a murderer, even, her grief<BR>
Had been mingled with pity and pardon; the one<BR>
Thing she could not forgive was the thing he had done.<BR>

His letters grew frequent; their tone, dignified,<BR>

Sweet sympathy mingled with praise in each line<BR>

She was still, to Maurice, an ideal.  A woman<BR>
Must be quite unselfish, almost superhuman,<BR>
And full of strong sympathy, who, in her soul,<BR>
Feels no wrench when she knows she has lost all control<BR>
O'er the heart of a man who once loved her.<BR>

<I>Mabel's Letter to Maurice.</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
To the song of your muse I have listened.  Oh, cease<BR>
To think of me but as a friend, dear Maurice.<BR>
Once a wife, a wife alway.  I vowed from my heart,<BR>
"For better, for worse, until death do us part."<BR>
No mention was made in the service that day<BR>
Of breaking my fetters if joy flew away.<BR>
"For better, for worse," a vow lightly spoken,<BR>
When Fate brings the "worse," how lightly 'tis broken!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The "worse," in my case, is the worst fate can give.<BR>
Tho' I shrank from the blow, I must bear it and live,<BR>
Not for self, but for duty; nor strive to evade<BR>
Fulfilling the promise I willingly made.<BR>
While Roger has sinned, and his sinning would be,<BR>
In the eyes of the law, proof to render me free,<BR>
It was God heard my vows and the Church sealed the bond.<BR>
Until one of us passes to death's dim beyond,<BR>
Though seas and though sins may divide us for life,<BR>
We are bound to each other as husband and wife.<BR>
In God's Court of Justice divorce is a word<BR>
Which falls without import or meaning when heard;<BR>
And the women who cast off old fetters that way,<BR>
To give place to the new, on the great Judgment Day<BR>
Must find, in the last summing up, that they stand<BR>
Side by side, in God's eyes, with the Magdalene band.<BR>
Dear Maurice, be my brother, my counselor, friend.<BR>
We are lonely without you and Ruth, at Bay Bend.<BR>
Come sometimes and brighten our lives; put away<BR>
The thoughts which are making you restless to-day<BR>
And give me your strong noble friendship; indeed<BR>
'Tis a friend that I crave, not a lover I need.<BR>

You write like a woman, and one, it is plain,<BR>
Whose sentiment hangs like a cloud o'er her brain.<BR>
You gaze through a sort of traditional mist,<BR>
And behold a mirage of God's laws which exist<BR>
But in fancy.  God made but one law&mdash;it is love.<BR>
A law for the earth, and the kingdoms above,<BR>
A law for the woman, a law for the man,<BR>
The base and the spire of His intricate plan<BR>
Of existence.  All evils the world ever saw<BR>
Had birth in man's breaking away from this law.<BR>
God cancels a marriage when love flies away.<BR>
"Till death do us part" should be altered to say,<BR>
"Till disgust or indifference part us."  I know<BR>
You never loved Roger, my heart tells me so.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
He won you, I claim, through a mesmeric spell;<BR>
You dreamed of an Eden, and wakened in hell.<BR>
You pitied his weakness, you struggled to save him,<BR>
He paid with a crime the devotion you gave him.<BR>
And the blackest of insults relentlessly hurled<BR>
At your poor patient heart in the gaze of the world.<BR>
In God's mighty ledger the stroke of a pen<BR>
Has been drawn through your record of marriage.  Though men<BR>
Call you wedded I hold you are widowed.  Why cling<BR>
To the poor, empty, meaningless form of a thing&mdash;<BR>
To the letter, devoid of all spirit?  God never<BR>
Intended a woman to hopelessly sever<BR>
Herself from all possible joy, or to make<BR>
True faithfulness suffer for faithlessness' sake.<BR>
When I think of your wrongs, when I think of my woes,<BR>
That black word divorce like a bright planet glows<BR>
In the skies of the future.  Oh, Mabel, be fair<BR>
To yourself and to me.  For the years of despair<BR>
I have suffered you owe me some recompense, surely.<BR>
The heart that has worshipped so long and so purely<BR>
Ought not to be slighted for mere sentiment.<BR>
We must live as our century bids us.  Its bent<BR>
Is away from the worn ruts of thought.  Where of old<BR>
The life of a woman was run in the mold<BR>
Of man's wishes and passions, to-day she is free;<BR>
Free to think and to act; free to do and to be<BR>
What she pleases.  The poor, pining victim of fate<BR>
And man's cruelty, long ago went out of date.<BR>
In the mansion of Life there were some things askew,<BR>
Which the strong hand of Progress has righted.  The new,<BR>
Better plan puts old notions of sex on the shelf.<BR>
Who is true to a knave, is untrue to herself.<BR>
Oh, be true to yourself, and have pity on one<BR>
Who has long dwelt in shadow and pines for the sun.<BR>
Love, starving on memories, begs for one taste<BR>
Of sweet hope, ere the remnant of youth goes to waste.<BR>

You write like a man who sees self as his goal.<BR>
You speak of your woes&mdash;yet my travail of soul<BR>
Seems mere sentiment to you.  Maurice, pause and think<BR>
Of the black, bitter potion life gave me to drink<BR>
When I dreamed of love's nectar.  Too fresh is the taste<BR>
Of its gall on my lip for my heart in such haste<BR>
To reach out for the cup that is proffered anew.<BR>
A certain respect to my sorrows is due.<BR>
I am weary of love as men know it.  The calm<BR>
Of a sweet, tranquil friendship would act like a balm<BR>
On the wounds of my heart; that platonic regard,<BR>
Which we read of in books, or hear sung by the bard,<BR>
But so seldom can find when we want it.  I thought,<BR>
For a time, you had conquered mere self, and had brought<BR>
Such a friendship to comfort and rest me.  But no,<BR>
That dream, like full many another, must go.<BR>
The love that is based on attraction of sex<BR>
Is a love that has brought me but sorrow.  Why vex<BR>
My poor soul with the same thing again?  If you love<BR>
With a higher emotion, you know how to prove<BR>
And sustain the assertion by conduct.  Maurice,<BR>
Love must rise above passion, to infinite peace<BR>
And serenity, ere it is love, to my mind.<BR>
For the women of earth, in the ranks of mankind<BR>
There are too many lovers and not enough friends.<BR>
'Tis the friend who protects, 'tis the lover who rends.<BR>
He who <I>can</I> be a friend while he <I>would</I> be a lover<BR>
Is the rarest and greatest of souls to discover.<BR>
Have I found, dear Maurice, such a treasure in you?<BR>
If not, I must say with this letter&mdash;adieu.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
As he finished the letter there seemed but one phrase<BR>
To the heart of the reader.  It shone on his gaze<BR>
Bright with promise and hope.  "<I>Too fresh is the taste<BR>
Of its gall on my lip for my heart in such haste<BR>
To reach out for the cup that is offered anew.</I>"<BR>
"<I>In such haste.</I>"  Ah, how hope into certainty grew<BR>
As he read and re-read that one sentence.  "Let fate<BR>
Take the whole thing in charge, I can wait&mdash;I can wait.<BR>
I have lived through the night; though the dawn may be gray<BR>
And belated, it heralds the coming of day."<BR>
So he talked with himself, and grew happy at last.<BR>
The five hopeless years of his sorrow were cast<BR>
Like a nightmare behind him.  He walked once again<BR>
With a joy in his personal life, among men.<BR>
There seemed to be always a smile on his lip,<BR>
For he felt like a man on the deck of a ship<BR>
Who has sailed through strange seas with a mutinous crew,<BR>
And now in the distance sights land just in view.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The house at Bay Bend was re-opened.  Once more,<BR>
Where the waves of the Sound wash the New England shore,<BR>
Walked Maurice; and beside him, young hope, with the tip<BR>
Of his fair rosy fingers pressed hard on his lip,<BR>
Urging silence.  If Mabel Montrose saw the boy<BR>
With the pursed prudent mouth and the eyes full of joy<BR>
She said nothing.  Grave, dignified (Ah, but so fair!),<BR>
There was naught in her modest and womanly air<BR>
To feed or encourage such hope.  Yet love grew<BR>
Like an air plant, with only the night and the dew<BR>
To sustain it; while Mabel rejoiced in the friend,<BR>
Who, in spite of himself, had come back to Bay Bend,<BR>
Yielding all to her wishes.  Such people, alone,<BR>
Who gracefully gave up their plans for her own,<BR>
Were congenial to Mabel.  Though looking the sweet,<BR>
Fragile creature, with feminine virtues replete,<BR>
Her nature was stubborn.  Beneath that fair brow<BR>
Lurked an obstinate purpose to make others bow<BR>
To herself in small matters.  She fully believed<BR>
She was right, always right; and her friends were deceived,<BR>
As a rule, into thinking the same; for her eyes<BR>
Held a look of such innocent grief and surprise<BR>
When her will was opposed, that one felt her misused,<BR>
And retired from the field of dispute, self-accused.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The days, like glad children, went hurrying out<BR>
From the schoolhouse of time; months pursued the same route<BR>
More sedately; a year, then two years, passed away,<BR>
Yet hope, unimpaired, in the lover's heart lay,<BR>
As a gem in the bed of a river might lie,<BR>
Unharmed and unmoved while its waters ran by.<BR>
His toil for the poor still continued, but not<BR>
With that fervor of zeal which a dominant thought<BR>
Lends to labor.  Fair love gilded dreams filled his mind,<BR>
While the corners were left for his suffering kind.<BR>
He was sorry for sorrow; but love made him glad,<BR>
And nothing in life now seemed hopeless or sad.<BR>
His tete-a-tete visits with Mabel were rare;<BR>
She ordered her life with such prudence and care<BR>
Lest her white name be soiled by the gossips.  And yet,<BR>
Though his heart, like a steed checked too closely, would fret<BR>
Sometimes at these creed-imposed fetters, he felt<BR>
Keen delight in her nearness; in knowing she dwelt<BR>
Within view of his high turret window.  Each day<BR>
Which gave him a glimpse of her, love laid away<BR>
As a poem in life's precious folio.  Night<BR>
Held her face like a picture, dream-framed for his sight.<BR>
So he fed on the crumbs from love's table, the while<BR>
Fate sat looking on with a cynical smile.<BR>

The women composing the class at Bellevue<BR>
Were young&mdash;under thirty; some pleasing to view,<BR>
Some plain.  Roman features prevailed, with brown hair,<BR>
But one was so feminine, soft eyed and fair<BR>
That she seemed out of place in a clinic, as though<BR>
A rose in a vegetable garden should grow.<BR>
While her face was intelligent, none would avow<BR>
That cold intellect dwelt on that fair oval brow,<BR>
Or looked out of the depths of those golden gray eyes,<BR>
The color of smoke against clear, sunny skies.<BR>
'Twas a warm woman face, made for fireside nooks,<BR>
Not a face to be bent over medical books.<BR>
There was nothing aggressive in features or form;<BR>
She was meant for still harbors, and not for the storm<BR>
And the strife of rude waters.  The swell of her breast<BR>
Suggested love's sweet downy cushion of rest<BR>
For the cheeks of fair children.  Her plump little hands,<BR>
Seemed fashioned for sewing small gussets and bands<BR>
And fussing with laces and ribbons, instead<BR>
Of cutting cold flesh and dissecting the dead.<BR>
And yet, as a student she ranked with the first.<BR>
But conscience, in labor once chosen, not thirst<BR>
For such knowledge, had spurred her to action.  This day<BR>
She seemed inattentive, her air was distrait,<BR>
As if thought had slipped free of the bridle and rein<BR>
And galloped away over memory's plain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It was true; it was strange, too, but there in the class,<BR>
While the learned man was talking, her mind seemed to pass<BR>
Out, away from the clinic, away from the town,<BR>
To a New England midsummer garden close down<BR>
By the salt water's edge; and she felt the wind blowing<BR>
Among her loose locks as she leaned o'er her sewing,<BR>
While the voice of a man stirred her heart into song.<BR>
She was called from her dream by the clang of the gong<BR>
Which foretells an arrival at Bellevue.  The class<BR>
Was dismissed for the day.  In the hall, forced to pass<BR>
By the stretcher (low brougham of misery), she<BR>
Whom we know was Ruth Somerville, looked down to see<BR>
The white, haggard face of the man whom her mind<BR>
Had strayed off in a waking day vision to find<BR>
But a moment before.<BR>

"This man lying here, either dying or dead,<BR>

In that turbulent heart yet; that heart torn with strife,<BR>

By the breadth of a hair," said the surgeon.  "The ball<BR>

For a new start on earth.  While a sober man might<BR>
Hope to conquer grim Death in this hand-to-hand fight,<BR>
Here old Alcohol stands as Death's second, fierce, cruel,<BR>

It called to the beast chained within us.  Her lips<BR>
Held the nectar that makes a man mad when he sips.<BR>
Her touch was delirium.  In the fierce joys<BR>
Of her kisses there lurked the fell curse which destroys<BR>
All such rapture&mdash;satiety.  When passion dies,<BR>

<I>Ruth's Letter to Maurice, Six Months Later.</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The springtime is here in our old home again,<BR>
Which again you have left.  Oh, most worthy of men,<BR>
Why grieve for unworthiness?  Why waste your life<BR>
For a woman who never was meant for a wife?<BR>
Mabel Lee has no love in her nature.  Your heart<BR>
Would have starved in her keeping.  She plays her new part,<BR>
As the faithful, forgiving, sweet spouse, with content.<BR>
I think she is secretly glad Roger went<BR>
Astray for a season.  She stands up still higher<BR>
On her pedestal, now, for Bay Bend to admire.<BR>
She is pleased with herself.  As for Roger, he trots<BR>
Like a lamb in her wake, with the blemishing spots<BR>
Of his sins washed away by the Church.  Oh I seem<BR>
To myself, in these days, like one waked from a dream<BR>
To blessed reality.  Off in the Bay<BR>
I saw a fair snowy sailed ship yesterday.<BR>
The masts shone like gold, and the furrowed waves laughed,<BR>
To be beat into foam by the beautiful craft.<BR>
But close in the harbor I saw the ship lying;<BR>
What seemed like the wings of a sea gull when flying,<BR>
Were weather stained sheets; there were no masts of gold,<BR>
And the craft was uncleanly, unseaworthy, old.<BR>
Well, the man whom I loved, and loved vainly, and whom<BR>
I fancied had shadowed my whole life with gloom,<BR>
Has been shown to my sight like that ship in the Bay,<BR>
And all my illusions have vanished away.<BR>
The man is by nature weak, selfish, unstable.<BR>
I think if some woman more loving than Mabel,<BR>
More tender, more tactful, less painfully good,<BR>
Had directed his home-life, perchance Roger would<BR>
Have evolved his best self, that pure atom of God,<BR>
Which lies deep in each heart like a seed in the sod.<BR>
'Tis the world's over-virtuous women, ofttimes,<BR>
Who drive men of weak will into sexual crimes.<BR>
I pity him.  (God knows I pity, each, all<BR>
Of the poor striving souls who grope blindly and fall<BR>
By the wayside of life.)  But the love which unbidden<BR>
Crept into my heart, and was guarded and hidden<BR>
For years, that has vanished.  It passed like a breath,<BR>
In the gray Autumn morning when Roger faced death,<BR>
As he thought, and uncovered his heart to my sight.<BR>
Like a corpse, resurrected and brought to the light,<BR>
Which crumbles to ashes, the love of my youth<BR>
Crumbled off into nothingness.  Ah, it is truth;<BR>
Love can die!  You may hold it is not the true thing,<BR>
Not the genuine passion, which dies or takes wing;<BR>
But the soil of the heart, like the soil of the earth,<BR>
May, at varying times of the seasons, give birth<BR>
To bluebells, and roses, and bright goldenrod.<BR>
Each one is a gift from the garden of God,<BR>
Though it dies when its season is over.  Why cling<BR>
To the withered dead stalk of the blossoms of spring<BR>
Through a lifetime, Maurice?  It is stubbornness only,<BR>
Not constancy, which makes full many lives lonely.<BR>
They want their own way, and, like cross children, fling<BR>
Back the gifts which, in place of the lost flowers of spring,<BR>
Fate offers them.  Life holds in store for you yet<BR>
Better things, dear Maurice, than a dead violet,<BR>
As it holds better things than dead daisies for me.<BR>
To Roger Montrose, let us leave Mabel Lee,<BR>
With our blessing.  They seem to be happy; or she<BR>
Seems content with herself and her province; while he<BR>
Has the look of one who, overfed with emotion,<BR>
Tries a diet of spiritual health-food, devotion.<BR>
He is broken in strength, and his face has the hue<BR>
Of a man to whom passion has bidden adieu.<BR>
He has time now to worship his God and his wife.<BR>
She seems better pleased with the dregs of his life<BR>
Than she was with the bead of it.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">Well, let them make</SPAN><BR>
What they will of their future.  Maurice, for my sake<BR>
And your own, put them out of your thoughts.  All too brief<BR>
And too broad is this life to be ruined by grief<BR>
Over one human atom.  Like mellowing rain,<BR>
Which enriches the soil of the soul and the brain,<BR>
Should the sorrow of youth be; and not like the breath<BR>
Of the cyclone, which carries destruction and death.<BR>
Come, Maurice, let philosophy lift you above<BR>
The gloom and despair of unfortunate love.<BR>
Sometimes, if we look a woe straight in the face,<BR>
It loses its terrors and seems commonplace;<BR>
While sorrow will follow and find if we roam.<BR>
Come, help me to turn the old house into home.<BR>
We have youth, health, and competence.  Why should we go<BR>
Out into God's world with long faces of woe?<BR>
Let our pleasures have speech, let our sorrows be dumb,<BR>
Let us laugh at despair and contentment will come.<BR>
Let us teach earth's repiners to look through glad eyes,<BR>
For the world needs the happy far more than the wise.<BR>
I am one of the women whose talent and taste<BR>
Lie in home-making.  All else I do seems mere waste<BR>
Of time and intention; but no woman can<BR>
Make a house seem a home without aid of a man.<BR>
He is sinew and bone, she is spirit and life.<BR>
Until the veiled future shall bring you a wife,<BR>
Me a mate (and both wait for us somewhere, dear brother),<BR>
Let us bury old corpses and live for each other.<BR>
You will write, and your great heart athrob through your pen<BR>
Shall strengthen earth's weak ones with courage again.<BR>
Where your epigrams fail, I will offer a pill,<BR>
And doctor their bodies with "new woman" skill.<BR>
(Once a wife, I will drop from my name the M. D.<BR>
I hold it the truth that no woman can be<BR>
An excellent wife and an excellent mother,<BR>
And leave enough purpose and time for another<BR>
Profession outside.  And our sex was not made<BR>
To jostle with men in the great marts of trade.<BR>
The wage-earning women, who talk of their sphere,<BR>
Have thrown the domestic machine out of gear.<BR>
They point to their fast swelling ranks overjoyed;<BR>
Forgetting the army of men unemployed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The banner of Feminine "Rights," when unfurled,<BR>
Means a flag of distress to the rest of the world.<BR>
And poor Cupid, depressed by such follies and crimes,<BR>
Sits weeping, alone, in the Land of Hard Times.<BR>
The world needs wise mothers, the world needs good wives,<BR>
The world needs good homes, and yet woman strives<BR>
To be everything else but domestic.  God's plan<BR>
Was for woman to rule the whole world, <I>through a man</I>.<BR>
There is nothing a woman of sweetness and tact<BR>
Can not do without personal effort or act.<BR>
She needs but infuse lover, husband or son<BR>
With her own subtle spirit, and lo! it is done.<BR>
Though the man is unconscious, full oft, of the cause,<BR>
And fancies himself the sole maker of laws.<BR>
Well, let him.  The cannon, no doubt, is the prouder<BR>
For not knowing its noise is produced by the powder.<BR>
Yet this is the law: <I>Who can love, can command</I>.)<BR>
But I wander too far from the subject in hand,<BR>
Which is, your home coming.  Make haste, dear; I find<BR>
More need every day of your counseling mind.<BR>
I work well in harness, but poorly alone.<BR>
Until that bright day when Fate brings us our own,<BR>
Let us labor together.  I see many ways,<BR>
Many tasks, for the use of our talents and days.<BR>
Your wisdom shall better the workingmen's lives,<BR>
While I will look after their daughters and wives,<BR>
And teach them to cook without waste; for, indeed,<BR>
It is knowledge like this which the poor people need,<BR>
Not the stuff taught in schools.  You shall help them to think,<BR>
While I show them what they can eat and can drink<BR>
With least cost, and most pleasure and benefit.  Please<BR>
Write me and say you will come, dear Maurice.<BR>
Home, sister, and duty are all waiting here;<BR>
Who keeps close to duty finds pleasure dwells near.<BR>

<I>Maurice's Letter to Ruth:</I><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No, no.  I have gambled with destiny twice,<BR>
And have staked my whole hopes on a home; but the dice<BR>
Thrown by Fate made me loser.  Henceforward, I know<BR>
My lot must be homeless.  The gods will it so.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I fought, I rebelled; I was bitter.  I strove<BR>
To outwit the great Cosmic Forces, above,<BR>
Or beyond, or about us, who guide and control<BR>
The course of all things from the moat to the soul.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The river may envy the peace of the pond,<BR>
But law drives it out to the ocean beyond.<BR>
If it roars down abysses, or laughs through the land,<BR>
It follows the way which the Forces have planned.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So man is directed.  His only the choice<BR>
To help or to hinder&mdash;to weep or rejoice.<BR>
But vain is refusal&mdash;and vain discontent,<BR>
For at last he must walk in the way that was meant.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
My way leads through shadow, alone to the end<BR>
I must work out my karma, and follow its trend.<BR>
I must fulfill the purpose, whatever it be,<BR>
And look not for peace till I merge in God's sea.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Though bankrupt in joy, still my life has its gain;<BR>
I have climbed the last round in the ladder of pain.<BR>
There is nothing to dread.  I have drained sorrow's cup<BR>
And can laugh as I fling it at Fate bottom up.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I have missed what I sought; yet I missed not the whole.<BR>
The best part of love is in loving.  My soul<BR>
Is enriched by its prodigal gifts.  Still, to give<BR>
And to ask no return, is my lot while I live.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Such love may be blindness, but where are love's eyes?<BR>
Such love may be folly, love seldom is wise.<BR>
Such love may be madness, was love ever sane?<BR>
Such love must be sorrow, for all love is pain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Love goes where it must go, and in its own season.<BR>
Love cannot be banished by will or by reason.<BR>
Love gave back your freedom, it keeps me its slave.<BR>
I shall walk in its fetters, unloved, to my grave.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So be it.  What right has the ant, in the dust,<BR>
To cry that the world is all wrong, and unjust,<BR>
Because the swift foot of a messenger trod<BR>
Down the home, and the hopes, that were built in the sod?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
What is man but an ant, in this universe scheme?<BR>
Though dear his ambition, and precious his dream,<BR>
God's messengers speed all unseen on their way,<BR>
And the plans of a lifetime go down in a day.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No matter.  The aim of the Infinite mind,<BR>
Which lies back of it all, must be great, must be kind.<BR>
Can the ant or the man, though ingenious and wise,<BR>
Swing the tides of the sea&mdash;set a star in the skies?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Can man fling a million of worlds into space,<BR>
To whirl on their orbits with system and grace?<BR>
Can he color a sunset, or create a seed,<BR>
Or fashion one leaf of the commonest weed?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Can man summon daylight, or bid the night fall?<BR>
Then how dare he question the Force which does all?<BR>
Where so much is flawless, where so much is grand,<BR>
All, all must be right, could our souls understand.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Ah, man, the poor egotist!  Think with what pride<BR>
He boasts his small knowledge of star and of tide.<BR>
But when fortune fails him, or when a hope dies,<BR>
The Maker of stars and of seas he denies!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I questioned, I doubted.  But that is all past;<BR>
I have learned the true secret of living at last.<BR>
It is, to accept what Fate sends, and to know<BR>
That the one thing God wishes of man&mdash;is to grow.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Growth, growth out of self, back to him&mdash;the First Cause:<BR>
Therein lies the purpose, the law of all laws.<BR>
Tears, grief, disappointment, well, what are all these<BR>
To the Builder of stars and the Maker of seas?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Does the star long to shine, when He tells it to set,<BR>
As the heart would remember when told to forget?<BR>
Does the sea moan for flood tide, when bid to be low,<BR>
As a soul cries for pleasure when given life's woe?<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In the Antarctic regions a volcano glows,<BR>
While low at its base lie the up-reaching snows.<BR>
With patient persistence they steadily climb,<BR>
And the flame will be quenched in the passage of time.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
My heart is the crater, my will is the snow,<BR>
Which yet may extinguish its volcanic glow.<BR>
When self is once conquered, the end comes to pain,<BR>
And that is the goal which I seek to attain.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I seek it in work, heaven planned, heaven sent;<BR>
In the kingdom of toil waits the crown of content.<BR>
Work, work! ah, how high and divine was its birth,<BR>
When God, the first laborer, fashioned the earth.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The world cries for workers; not toilers for pelf,<BR>
But souls who have sought to eliminate self.<BR>
Can the lame lead the race?  Can the blind guide the blind?<BR>
We must better ourselves ere we better our kind.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There are wrongs to be righted; and first of them all,<BR>
Is to lift up the leaners from Charity's thrall.<BR>
Sweet, wisdomless Charity, sowing the seed<BR>
Which it seeks to uproot, of dependence and need.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For vain is the effort to give man content<BR>
By clothing his body, by paying his rent.<BR>
The garment re-tatters, the rent day recurs;<BR>
Who seeks to serve God by such charity errs.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Give light to the spirit, give strength to the mind,<BR>
And the body soon cares for itself, you will find.<BR>
First, faith in God's wisdom, then purpose and will,<BR>
And, like mist before sunlight, shall vanish each ill.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
To the far realm of Wisdom there lies a short way.<BR>
To find it we need but the password&mdash;Obey.<BR>
Obey like the acorn that falls to the sod,<BR>
To rise, through the heart of the oak tree, to God.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Though slow be the rising, and distant the goal,<BR>
Serenity waits at the end for each soul.<BR>
I seek it.  Not backward, but onward I go,<BR>
And since sorrow means growth, I will welcome my woe.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In the ladder of lives we are given to climb,<BR>
Each life counts for only a second of time.<BR>
The one thing to do in the brief little space,<BR>
Is to make the world glad that we ran in the race.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No soul should be sad whom the Maker deemed worth<BR>
The great gift of song as its dower at birth.<BR>
While I pass on my way, an invisible throng<BR>
Breathes low in my ear the new note of a song.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So I am not alone; for by night and by day<BR>
These mystical messengers people my way.<BR>
They bid me to hearken, they bid me be dumb<BR>
And to wait for the true inspiration to come.<BR>
